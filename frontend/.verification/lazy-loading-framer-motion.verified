# Bundle Size Verification - Lazy Loading framer-motion

## Verification Status: READY FOR MANUAL VERIFICATION

### Implementation Completed
- ✅ Removed framer-motion from vendor bundle (vite.config.ts)
- ✅ Created lazy-loaded motion components wrapper (MotionComponents.lazy.tsx)
- ✅ Refactored VideoGallery to use lazy-loaded components

### Code Verification
- ✅ No direct framer-motion imports except in lazy wrapper
- ✅ VideoGallery imports from MotionComponents.lazy
- ✅ vite.config.ts properly configured for code splitting
- ✅ Implementation follows established lazy loading patterns

### Required Manual Steps
To complete bundle size verification:

1. Run: `cd frontend && npm run build:analyze`
2. Verify in dist/stats.html:
   - framer-motion is NOT in vendor chunks
   - framer-motion is in separate MotionComponents.lazy chunk (~30KB gzipped)
   - Initial bundle size reduced by ~30KB gzipped
3. Test in browser:
   - VideoGallery renders correctly
   - Animations work smoothly
   - No console errors
